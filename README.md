# password-generator 🗝️
## Short descreption 😍
This project is one of the 3 projects I created when I was taking the javaScript course at scrimba. It's basically a website that helps create 2 random 15 characters long **passwords** and they can be copied just by clicking on one of them . I hope you like it.
